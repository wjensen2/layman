## ✨ What It Does

Layman takes confusing legal, financial, and official documents and breaks them down into three simple sections:

- **📄 What it says** - A plain English summary of the document
- **🧠 What it means** - What this means for you personally  
- **⚡ What you need to do** - Clear action items and deadlines

- Utility bills and payment notices
- Loan modifications and financial agreements
- Tax assessment notices
- Legal correspondence
- Government forms and notices

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
2. **Drag and drop** a PDF or image file onto the upload area
3. **Wait for processing** - watch the retro progress bar!
4. **Read your summary** in three easy sections
5. **Download** your summary as a text file
6. **Upload another** document anytime

## 📁 Supported File Types

- **PDF files** (.pdf) - Perfect for official documents
- **Images** (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif) - For photos of paper documents

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Inspired by 1997-era desktop software with:
- Authentic window chrome and controls
- Classic 3D button styling  
- Retro system fonts and colors
- Nostalgic progress bars and dialogs
- Desktop-style taskbar with clock
